I am in the industry for 20 years now. I wrote my first programs in Basic then a bit later in C when I was 10 years old and since then I never stopped programming. I love programming and I love to work with good people in a good corporate culture. I am open, conscientious, and I appreciate those qualities in a corporate culture, an agile approach to work and the development, I like to help to my colleagues to write better code, tests, to learn patterns, new architectures and new ways in programming.
