      <description>I am in the industry for 20 years now. I wrote my first programs in Basic, then a bit later in C, when I was 10 years old, and since then I never stopped programming. I love programming and I love to work with good people in a good corporate culture. I am open and conscientious, and I appreciate those qualities in corporate culture and an agile approach to work and development.</description>
